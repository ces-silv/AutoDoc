# AutoDoc

This was a Second Year College Project for a Gynecologist Clinic.

We used an external library to create PDF files, all this project was developed using C++. We also used some cmd commands, such as "mkdir" to create new folders to store the Patience data.

Feel free to use it with Educational Purposes.
