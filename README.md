# 📄 AutoDoc - Gynecologist Clinic Project

Welcome to the **AutoDoc** project! This project was developed as part of a second-year college assignment for a **Gynecologist Clinic**. The goal of this project was to streamline the creation of medical documents for patients by generating **PDF files** automatically.

### ⚙️ Technology Stack
- **C++** (Primary programming language used)
- **External Library** (For PDF generation)
- **CMD Commands** (Used for folder management, e.g., `mkdir` to create patient data folders)

This system is designed to simplify administrative tasks and improve efficiency in medical documentation. The generated PDFs contain essential information about patients and their medical history.

### 🎓 Educational Use
Feel free to use and modify this project for **educational purposes**. It is an excellent example of how to combine programming, file management, and PDF generation in a real-world scenario.
